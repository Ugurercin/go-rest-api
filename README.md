# Go REST API Project

## **Introduction**

Welcome to my **Go REST API project**! This initiative is a deep dive into the Go programming language, focusing on its fundamental concepts and best practices. As a novice Go developer, this project is my sandbox for experimenting with **structs, pointers, methods, receiver functions**, and other critical Go idioms.

This API is a straightforward platform allowing user authentication, token issuance, and basic **CRUD** operations. Through building it, I've gotten hands-on experience with **JWT**, basic **ORM** practices in Go, and more.

## **Features**

- **User Authentication**: Implements a secure login process and JWT token issuance for session management.
- **CRUD Operations**: Users can create, read, update, and delete data, practicing essential database interactions.
- **Token-based Authorization**: Utilizes JWT for secure access control, ensuring users can only access their permitted resources.
- **Basic ORM**: Explores basic Object-Relational Mapping techniques for effective database manipulation in Go.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Go (Golang)**: The backbone of the project, used for all backend development.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For secure authentication and session management.
- **ORM Tools in Go**: For database interactions, simplifying CRUD operations in a Go-like manner.
