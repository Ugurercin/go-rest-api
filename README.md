Go REST API Project
Introduction
Welcome to my Go REST API project! This project serves as a practical exploration into the Go programming language, focusing on understanding and applying its key concepts and idioms. As someone who has recently embarked on learning Go, I've created this project to deepen my knowledge in areas such as structs, pointers, methods, receiver functions, and more.

The API offers a simple yet effective platform for users to interact with, providing functionalities like user authentication, CRUD operations, and token-based authorization using JWTs. Additionally, this project has allowed me to experiment with basic ORM techniques tailored for Go, aiming to provide a robust solution for managing and interacting with data.

Features
User Authentication: Secure login mechanism with JWT token generation for authenticated sessions.
CRUD Operations: Comprehensive Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities for user data.
Token-based Authorization: Enhanced security through JWT, ensuring that users can only access resources they are permitted to.
Basic ORM: Implementation of basic Object-Relational Mapping approaches to interact with databases seamlessly.
Technologies
This project is implemented using the Go programming language and leverages various Go packages and methodologies for efficient API development. Key technologies include:

Go (Golang): The core programming language used for developing the API.
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For implementing token-based authentication and authorization.
Go ORM Tools: To abstract and simplify database operations in a Go-idiomatic way.
